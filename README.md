I.S.A. - I Speak Again - TESTING
================================

**This is a developing version**

I.S.A., which stands for I Speak Again, is a virtual keyboard to help speech
and mobility impaired people (like people with ALS disease). It's made up of
different kind of boards (SpeechBoard, ImageBoard, WordBoard). Each of these
ones have been realized as a web application (HTML5, CSS3, JQuery, PHP) and
they are accessible from a standard web browser. The entire solution can also
be installed on a local machine. The solution is completed by using a
webcam-mouse pointer (head/eye controlled) provided by one of the free
software that we have selected


So far we are using the [Festival][] open source project as text-to-speech
engine. Our intent is to improve ISA with a better quality voices and we
have realized a plugin architecture to allow the integration of different TTS
engines.

I.M.A. - I Move Again
=====================
This branch includes the IMA module. IMA allows to control a wheelchair using
a eye tracking system. The module integrates a virtual joystick to steer the
wheelchair and interacts with Arduino through a USB cable connection.

Contributing
============

ISA is an open source, community-driven project. If you'd like to contribute,
please follow the guidelines in the next sections.

1. Coding Style
---------------

When contributing code to ISA, you must follow its coding standards. To make a
long story short, here is the golden rule: Imitate the existing ISA code.

Remember that the main advantage of standards is that every piece of code
looks and feels familiar, it's not about this or that being more readable.

ISA follows the standards defined in the [PSR-0][], [PSR-1][] and [PSR-2][]
documents.

[PSR-0]: https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md
[PSR-1]: https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md
[PSR-2]: https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md

Since a picture - or some code - is worth a thousand words, here's a short
example containing most features described below:

```php

namespace Vendor\Package;

use BarClass as Bar;
use OtherVendor\OtherPackage\BazClass;

/**
 * Coding standards demonstration.
 */
class FooBar
{
    const SOME_CONST = 157;

    private $fooBar;

    /**
     * @param string $a Some argument description
     * @param string $b Some argument description
     * @param array $c
     *
     * @return string|null Transformed input
     */
    public function sampleFunction($a, $b = null, $c = array())
    {
        if ($a === $b) {
            bar();
        } elseif ($a > $b) {
            $foo->fooBar($arg1);
        } else {
            BazClass::bar($arg2, $arg3);
        }
        
        // some code
        
        return $dummy;
    }
}
```

### 1.1 Indenting and Line Length

Code must use an indent of 4 spaces, with no tabs. Using only spaces, and not
mixing spaces with tabs, helps to avoid problems with diffs, patches, history,
and annotations. The use of spaces also makes it easy to insert fine-grained
sub-indentation for inter-line alignment.

Here is an example of rules that will set up VIM editor:

```
set expandtab
set shiftwidth=4
set softtabstop=4
set tabstop=4
```

It is recommended to keep each line under 80 characters for better code
readability. However, longer lines are acceptable in some circumstances. The
maximum length of any line of PHP code is 120 characters.

### 1.2 File Formatting

- All PHP files must use the Unix LF (linefeed) line ending.

> Note: Line termination follows the Unix text file convention. Lines must
end with a single linefeed (LF) character. Do not use carriage returns (CR)
as is the convention in Apple OS's  or the carriage return - linefeed
combination (CRLF) as is standard for the Windows OS.

- All PHP files must end with a single blank line.
- The closing `?>` tag must be omitted from files containing only PHP code.

> Note: For files that contain only PHP code, the closing tag ("?>") is
never permitted. It is not required by PHP, and omitting it prevents the
accidental injection of trailing white space into the response.

### 1.3 Structure

- Add a single space after each comma delimiter;
- Add a single space around operators (`==`, `&&`, ...);
- Add a comma after each array item in a multi-line array, even after the
  last one;
- Add a blank line before return statements, unless the return is alone inside
  a statement-group (like an if statement);
- Use braces to indicate control structure body regardless of the number of
  statements it contains;
- Opening braces for classes must go on the next line, and closing braces must
  go on the next line after the body;
- Opening braces for methods must go on the next line, and closing braces must
  go on the next line after the body;
- Opening braces for control structures must go on the same line, and closing
  braces must go on the next line after the body;
- Opening parentheses for control structures must not have a space after them,
  and closing parentheses for control structures must not have a space before;
- Define one class per file;
- Declare class properties before methods;
- Declare public methods first, then protected ones and finally private ones;
- Use parentheses when instantiating classes regardless of the number of
  arguments the constructor has.

### 1.4 Naming Conventions

- Use StudlyCaps for class names;
- Use camelCase, not underscores, for variable, function and method names,
  arguments;
- Use underscores for option names and parameter names;
- Use namespaces for all classes;
- Use upper case with underscore separators for class constants;
- Use alphanumeric characters and underscores for file names;
- Don't forget to look at the more verbose Conventions document for more
  subjective naming considerations.

Report Issue/Bugs

If your problem definitely looks like a bug, report it using the official bug
[tracker][] and follow some basic rules:
- Use the title field to clearly describe the issue;
- Describe the steps needed to reproduce the bug with short examples;
- Give as much detail as possible about your environment (OS, PHP version,
  ISA version, ...);
- (optional) Attach a patch.
